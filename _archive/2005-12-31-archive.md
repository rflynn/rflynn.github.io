Thankfully, the book is written in a fairly politically nuetral way, and aims to explain rather than to slander or lay blame (which is all one gets from the media). I now feel like I have a reasonable 10,000-foot view on how and why al Queda was created and why the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. The one piece of mis-information that is passed on as legitimate (and only i believe due to the publishing date) was the reiteration that Saddam Hussein was found hiding in a hole, which is not true.

	been spending all my spare time on <b>lanmap</b>, my project to turn <i>passively-collected</i> lan traffic into a single cohesive
	graph. a lot of my time has been spent on OS detection... it is quite possible to discern, from a small amount of basic
	passively-collected network traffic, what operating system is sending it.
	i've installed the excellent <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> and have been trying to get my hands on all OSes
	i can to test them. so far: linux 2.x, (net|free|open|dragonfly)bsd, mac os (9|x), win(98|nt4|2k-sp[1-6]|xp-sp[012]), cisco ios
	and novell netware. i'm trying to get my hands on linux 1.x, dos, win95, win3.1 and i still need to figure out how to ID
	printers.

	i need the following data for research, if you're interested: network captures (.pcap format if possible, check out
	<a href="http://ethereal.com/">ethereal</a>) of basic network activity (web browsing, pings/pongs) <b>from</b> a known machine or
	machines along with a list of IPs -&gt; Operating System. be as specific as possible with OS, <i>WinXP</i> won't cut it,-->
	i need <i>Windows XP Pro 2002 Service Pack 2 + firewall</i>. i'm not interested in the content of the web page you're browsing,
	or to whom you're sending PINGs; i'm interested in the actual structure of the packet headers.
	in particular i'd like caps of the following OSes:
	<ul>
		<li>WinXP pre-SP1
		<li>Windows Vista Beta
		<li>Linux 2.0 and 1.x-based distros
		<li>Windows 3.11
		<li>Windows 95
		<li>Windows 98
		<li>Windows ME
		<li>Windows NT 3.51
		<li>Windows NT 4 various Service Packs
		<li>Solaris, any version
		<li>Cisco IOS, any version
		<li>DOS, any version
		<li>MacOS 8 or earlier
		<li>OS/2, any version
		<li>any dedicated routers/firewalls
		<li>any embedded OS
		<li>anything running on non-x86 platforms
		<li>anything weird i haven't mentioned that supports ethernet
	</ul>
	email the pcap files to <b>parseerror *at* gmail</b>. thanks in advance!
	<p>
	lanmap should compile and run on Linux, Windows and the BSDs (including OS X); lemme know. you'll need:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">libpcap</a> (NOTE: the windows version is included in the project; *nix probably already has, it's
		part of the ubiquitous tcpdump)
		<li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> to generate the resulting graphs
	</ul>
	you can get a zip of the current repository <a href="~pizza/lanmap/lanmap-current.zip">lanmap-current.zip</a>, or if you're interested
	in possibly contributing....<p>
	<code>svn co svn://parseerror.dyndns.org/lanmap/trunk/ lanmap</code>
	<p>
	NOTE: sorry, but my svn server is currently my laptop, which travels with me; this won't always work.
	best bet is weeknights, EST. need to find a real home for this project.
	<p>
	*nix users can just type <code>make</code>, windows users need Visual Studio .NET to compile the .sln
	(the .proj might work in VS6, haven't tried)
	<p>
	on *nix, run with superuser privileges (yes, that sucks and is inherently more dangerous)
	<p>
	every 60 seconds(default) the file graph/lanmap.png will be updated with the latest and greatest picture of the network,
	as the box you're running on sees things.

	i've been busy the last few weeks working on producing a visual map of a live network <em>using only passively-collected traffic</em>.
	using <a href="http://tcp-dump.org">libpcap</a> to fetch raw traffic and using <a href="http://graphviz.org">graphviz</a>
	to produce the visuals, i wrote a couple thousands of lines of C to parse and keep track of many different types of
	network traffic.
	the OS detection stinks and some stuff is wrong, but it's actually not a bad representation. so far it parses Ethernet2, IEEE 802.3,
	LLC, CDP, STP, ARP, IP, UDP, TCP, IPX, SAP, ICMP, BOOTP and NETBIOS datagram. i've attempted DNS, what a nightmare DNS is to parse.
	i'm not using any database to store the data, it's all in hash tables, which keeps the app more self-contained and keeps
	dependencies low, but limits the kind of reporting i can do. there's still lots to improve... i've been looking at michael zalewski's
	<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.shtml">p0f</a> tool; it is much more elegant, simple and fool-proof than my OS detection,
	i should probably incorporate it.<p>
	it is amazing what machines will send out to the network... ethernet manufacturer is mantainable by MAC address prefix, most
	OSes will send out OS name and version in the &quot;vendor class&quot; entry of a BOOTP message, OS hints can be found in
	ICMP echo requests (pings) and traceroute pings. OS is determinable from most HTTP User-Agent strings. some of that is
	easily faked. p0f on the other hand, can detect most OSes purely by analyzing TCP SYN headers against a database of
	known fingerprints, and can also detect things like NAT and firewalls, not quite sure how yet.<p>
	other things i need to figure out is how better to handle traffic to/from gateways, and also come up with a more informative
	visual representation of machines based on what i know about them. also, identification of printers, and better handling of
	bridges and routers.<p>
	this graph was generated using graphviz's `twopi` program, which generates a circular undirected graph... the `neato` program
	generates better output, but crashes when using external images as nodes, i'm trying to debug and correct this error...<p>
	<code>svn co svn://parseerror.dyndns.org/lanmap/trunk/ lanmap</code><p>
	so far the code has been compiled using gcc 3.3.5 on linux and gcc 4.0 on mac os x. the project isn't mature or robust, but
	it probably won't crash, definitely won't disrupt your network and just might show you something interesting.
	if you can compile it and run it i'd be interested to see what your graphs look like.

it has to do with bash's tendency to <b>expand</b> (i just found GLOBIGNORE...)
and the -l thing has to do with GNU-style argument handling

there is a small black spider crawling around on my white walls as i type this. i've been watching
him for the last few minutes. he crawls a few steps, then stops; repeating this movement pattern pattern
all the way up the side of the window. i can't decide whether to kill him or let him be. i am grossed out
by bugs, yet part of me feels that he has done no wrong to me and deserves to live. i wonder why he travels
in the stop-and-go pattern. my inclination is to believe that it is an inherited trait. his stutter-stepping 
traits of his ancestors must have helped him survive against birds that ate his ancenstor's constantly-moving
friends. boy, he sure does move slow, he's only gone a few feet as i've been (slowly) typing this. funny how
hard it is to articulate one's blurry, half-formed thoughts to unambiguous English. i should learn a language
that's better than English, like Mandarin. should take a class. but not now; sleep();

	<li class="windows">I hate Windows! Here's a short, poorly thought out list of why:
		<ul class="windows">
			<li>AIM always crashes on close.
			<li>No real shell or way to do simple, customizable batch processing like an ugly
line of bash or a small script.
			<li>In Display Properties (right-click Desktop, Properties, Desktop) if you click
&quot;Browse&quot; you get the last dir you selected a background from, great. The next time
you click it you get a random reset directory browser and you have to navigate to your wallpaper
dir from then on.
			<li>Crappy skins. Changing color makes entire system halt (and fade to b&amp;w) for
5-10 seconds, wtf?! Hell even openbox/fluxbox gets this right.
			<li>If you manage to hit the wrong key combo in Visual Studio, which I've done
a few times in the past few months, yet can't figure out what it is, Visual Studio just goes into
some insane processing loop which ties up disk and chews memory until you run out. Only way
to stop it is hard reboot. I don't think it's a compile, because Ctrl+Break doesn't work.
			<li>I tried using Visio today to do some simple UML stuff. Visio is unusable!
The page layout stuff is terrible and completely tied to the user micro-managing a print-centric
set of documents, which have to be adjusted and readjusted as the document grows.
Also, when you create Datatypes and then cut and paste them you get duplicates in the datatypes
list on the left side. Combined with the tiny and non-resizable datatype list and it can take
10 seconds to surf to fill in the datatype field for each attribute and function.
Not fun if there's 50 of them. So i deleted some of the duplicate entries to shrink the humongous
list with the itty bitty scrollbar and Visio went ahead and deleted the datatypes i had drawn,
but still kept them in the list. 3 hours of my life I will never get back. What a piece of shit.
			<li>IE's CSS support is horrid, and its security record is laughable.
		</ul>
		But you know what, Firefox sucks too. It chews up an enormous amount of memory and never
gives it back until it is shut down.

<span class="date">2005-03-21</span>
Had a great weekend in NYC. Got some good stuff done at work... another day. At every one of my previous jobs I always had a serious side-project going, at my new job I have considered it but haven't started one and am in no particular hurry. I think this is because I am finally getting my &quot;fill&quot; of challenging programming from work and at the end of the day the last characters I want to see are ), ( and ;<p>
That reminds me, I'm out of books. I finished Peter Matthiessen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140255087/qid=1110172941/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-0345187-4175333?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Snow Leopard</a>. The book is really less about animals and more about the author's spiritual journey into the mountains of Nepal. A serious student of Zen and a Buddhist, Matthiessen reflects in his work much more than the beautiful land, hard journey and people around him. I hate traditional religion, but what Matthiessen talks about is much less about God than it is understanding the world around him and his own soul. The book is quite deep, although I find myself unable to succinctly sum up what is inside. Nonetheless, an excellent book for anyone who loves travel.<p>
The only question is what to read next. I had some really excellent, smooth, tasty sake over the weekend which made me realize how shitty the sake was that I used to get at my regular sushi place back in Las Vegas. I think I'll <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0804834253/ref=pd_sim_b_1/103-6876737-9675832?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance">read up on sake</a>. I also have never read Machiavelli's The Prince, so what the hell. I need to find a library around here.

aw yeah, firefox is sexy. this is a listing (in IE(!)) of files from kirk's counter-strike stats analysis tool; it generates a boatload of files, but it's oh-so-informative! my current K/D ratio: 1.38, much improved from my initial 0.62. in other news, i forgot an #ifndef X #define X #endif wrapper in one of my new .h files and Visual Studio just sat compiling the .c file, chewing up cpu and memory.

	<li style="list-style-image:url(images/icons/big-apple.gif)" class="nyc"><a class="date">2005-02-19</a>
on friday night i took the train into nyc. never underestimate how brutally cold it can be waiting for
the train. on the bright side i met and had decent conversations with 2 cute girls; why do i have luck
with women at such weird locations? well anyways, i'm spoken for so it doesn't matter.<p>
woke up saturday morning very hungry (no dinner on friday), thought it would be thematic to buy tangerines
and go look at <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/thegates/home.html">The Gates</a> in
<a href="http://www.centralpark.org/">Central Park</a>.
i walked a block, bought some tangerines at a fruit stand, walked another 1/2 block towards CP, turned
around and went back. it was so brutally, unbelievably cold i could not go any further. it was so cold
my eyes were trying to cry but everything was frozen. too cold for sitting in the park and eating frickin
tangerines.<p>
put on my warmest attire; hit up nearby deli/resturant for split pea soup. one pint, $3.50. walked a few
brutally cold blocks to the park. saw The Gates. walked for a bit, found a bench, ate soup. tried to eat soup.
in the 5 minutes i had walked the piping hot soup had gone luke-warm. yuck. choked down a few spoonfuls and
threw it out. chose a direction and just walked. the orange gates were everywhere. as a NYTimes editorial noted
the gates are not 'saffron', but orange. the color of Home Depot; the color of traffic cones. i noticed after
walking for a bit that they were of varying width, greatly varying in some instances. i took my glove off and
grabbed the cloth of one of the gates. it was soft and had texture; like a thick dishtowel. i walked for
what seemed like no time at all and i ran out of park. i was at Columbus Circle, at the southwest corner. i
had walked a dozen blocks without even noticing. i hopped up on a stone wall and just sat there taking in the
circle. i looked up at <a href="http://www.trumpintl.com/">Trump Tower</a> on my right. people were everywhere.
cops were everywhere. everyone was taking touristy pictures of each other at the The Gates.
i wonder how many people came to NYC just for them.<p>
i would have sat longer, just taking it all in, but the stone wall on which i was sitting was so cold it
went right through my jeans, through my gloves and my hands, and completely froze my ass. as i walked the
dozen blocks northwards on Central Park West rubbing my ass the whole way.<p>
next up: shopping. i'm not a big shopper. i own one pair of jeans which i've used for work and play for over
one year. i have clothes hanging around that my mom has bought me, simply because they still fit and look decent.
many people i know treat clothes like a car lease or an apartment. they pay and pay and pay, use them for a few
months and then get all-new ones. i don't know how such people get rid of their clothes... do they throw them
out? i hardly buy any clothes and i still have too many. perhaps i just don't throw them out fast enough.<p>
if you're this kind of person, the next time you're getting rid of your clothes make sure to give them to a
charitable organization like the <a href="http://www.satruck.com/Index.asp">Salvation Army</a> or
<a href="http://goodwill.org/">Goodwill</a>, because this is where i buy clothes. don't feel pity
for me, i have enough money so that i could afford to buy a few pairs of jeans every year for $100/each.
button-down shirts at __Mall_Store_Here__ for $40 apiece. Shoes for $80. But I won't. I just think it's silly.<p>
but first i needed to find a thriftshop. i'm looking after my girl's apartment; i swear i've seen a yellow pages
here somewhere, but after 15 minutes of not finding it i'm begininng to doubt my memory. i run downstairs to the
store on the first floor, they are thoroughly nice and i borrow their yellow pages for 10 minutes while i listen
to some fat loser next to me drone on to his 'woman' about how &quot;if you're going to to leave me you need to 
tell me you're leaving and if you're not going to leave me then you need to tell me&quot;. i write down the names
of a dozen thrift shops, thank the guys for the favor and get the hell out of there. most of the thrift shops
are more or less clustered within 10 blocks on the east side; i am on the west side, and there are about 4 shops
spread out at 15 block intervals along it. being a man of lowest-common-denominators i just walk to the closest
shop, about 7 blocks away. inside is junk, lots of it. women's junk. more women's junk. i find the men's junk
after more than a little confusion. i find 2 shirts that are decent and most importantly one of those dark
jackets with big buttons and most importantly it was almost a great fit, which is a big deal for me, so i grabbed
that stuff and got the hell outta there. 2 button-up shirts and a warm, jacket that didn't make me look like
a criminal (like my current one seemed to) for $60. on the way back i noticed a basement barber giving $15 haircuts,
and since i needed one i figure what the hell. the man next to me got a middle-eastern barber with a sense of humor
and a mouth that wouldn't shut. i got an eastern european girl who was all business. she frowned and fretted
as i took off my hat; i hadn't had a haircut in months. no non-logistical discussion whatsoever. but she was
alright at what she did, so it's ok to be serious. but it made me realize that being too serious about your
job can put other people off.<p>
i was hoping to cook some asian-style food, but as i went through my girlfriend's food i realized that while
i am good at eating it i don't know my way around real asian food at all; not enough to cook any of it. so i
got some mexican food and watched the Univ. of Virginia basketball team give Maryland a real fight for 2 hours
and then completely fall to pieces in double overtime. as for the rest of the game, the announcers would have
you believe the
kids are walking on water, but here are grown men, many of them making more money than i do, missing layups
and free-throws in a serious manner. american basketball players are so fundamentally unsound it pains me to
watch it. if you notice the college players execute their dunks will greater fluidicity than they do their
free-throws, which just goes to show you what their priorities are.<p>
i rented <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/">Troy</a>, and i must say it was extremely mediocre. i
suppose psuedo-historical war flicks are forced into a certain style, but even Gladiator had more of a soul than
this. Brian Cox's Agamemnon was just horribly written and i feel sorry for him because he is a very good actor
whose talent was wasted. Orlando Bloom on the other hand did a terrific job playing the
weak-willed-creepy-teenage-boyfriend role of Paris, which i definately don't mean as a compliment. that guy
cannot act. legolas was his high-point; an absolutely perfect role for him. Brad Pitt's Achilles was of course
the only somewhat interesting thing in the entire movie, because he occasionally got suited up for battle
and inflicted death and destruction, and because everything else in the movie was so monotonous that was all
there was of which to look forward.<p>
The was the end of my day, I wanted to make a trip to the bookstore but due to poor planning on my part it
was too late. the next morning i woke up, did my chores and took the train home.<p>

spent the majority of today trying to figure out why my code didn't work on a combination of win2k and a certain
serial&harr;ethernet bridge. it worked on the bridge with xp and it worked with win2k with a different model bridge.
spent a lot of time in <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/">ethereal</a>... and guess what? it helped me figure out
the problem in a big way... i dunno what i'd do without it.
it looks like xp would re-send the app protocol's sync message, whereas 2k would only send it once (i only
logically called a single send)... so i added a second call and it magically works... sigh. well, at least i
fixed it &mdash; but it bothers me because i don't know why xp would send the message twice... also, during the
experience i noticed that win2k sends a <code>RST, ACK</code> to any connection to a non-listening port, whereas
winxp sends nothing; it was also interesting to observe the bridge behavior as it cycled from ports 1023&hellip;900
and then started over again

people at Dell (this is a work laptop, no way in hell i'd buy a Dell) shipped me a ATI Radeon Mobility 9000
card in November 2004 with drivers from 2002 which were buggy! after scouring ATI's website (which was a
complete waste of time and very frustrating), Dell.com (no help) and third-party driver sites (none of the
drivers would install) my brother pointed me to <a href="http://www.omegadrivers.net/">OmegaDrivers.net</a>,
a kickass third-party drivers site. Their stuff installed and not only fixed the problem but offers many
more features than the ATI drivers that came with the card.
