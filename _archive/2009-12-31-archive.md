Over the years I have found myself, time and time again, arriving at the conclusion that every single piece of mainstream
software is defective. Mature, important software continues to ship with huge numbers of defects. Furthermore, this
doesn't seem to bother anyone; the software world focuses on the details and workarounds of the latest exploit or
crash, instead of asking why they existed in the first place. This bothers me.<p>
Perhaps it is <a href="http://despair.com/consulting.html">consultants' logic</a> at work. Perhaps it is the
dominant view of the time, missing the forest for the trees, the overwhelming pervasiveness of the problem, or
a problem for which engineers are ill-suited to solve. I don't know.<p>
Blaming defects on the engineers that wrote them is, although comforting and not necessarily incorrect, not the full
story. The real defect is development and release methodologies which put complete trust in the unverifiable
perfection of every single line of an encylopedia-sized tome compiled over time by disparate, imperfect sources.<p>
Unit testing is simply incomplete. Tests are the equivalent to blacklists; incomplete, unverifiable lists of known,
bad entities. The blacklist model is necessarily incomplete because it is reactionary &mdash; new tests are added
only when new bugs are found. Bugs that are not found are not tested. Bugs that are not considered, tested and fixed
by a human lay dormant in software.<p>
Bugs in common codepaths are found soon; bugs in less-common codepaths
<a href="http://www.vnode.ch/fixing_seekdir">may exist in widely-used, high-quality software for decades before they are found</a>.
The number of undiscovered bugs is impossible to determine.<p>
I am convinced that the slow, methodical construction of software from provably defect-free components
is the only sane way to develop software with predictable behavior; everything else is, at some level,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">cowboy coding</a>.<p>
The current problem with verifying things like operating systems is that they are not designed to be verified.
Operating systems are written in languages like platform-specific assembly or C, instead of the abstract symbolic
languages used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_prover">theorem provers</a>. Those wishing to
<a href="http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/">prove the correctness of an operating system</a> must first
translate it into a theorem-prover-friendly language before it can be proved.<p>
I posit that this approach, though practical given the circumstances, is working in the wrong direction.
Software should be designed and proven symbolically first, and then automatically translated into the target
language.<p>
This would be slow at first but each subsequent instruction, data structure and algorithm would build upon the last,
providing a solid foundation upon which further layers may be developed. Proposed modifications or additions to proven
modules would be proven defect-free before it was tested and released, instead of being tested after defects are found.<p>
So, in the meantime, I'm going to be learning how to read and write mathematical proofs.

<li class=think>Challenge: add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution">speculative execution</a>
to $YOUR_FAVORITE_SHELL (bash, zsh, etc).<p>
Speculative execution is the (side-effect free) execution of code with the expectation that its results will probably be
useful in the near future. That is, if we can guess with high probability what someone will do next, then we do stuff <b>before</b>
we're asked. If we predict correctly we apply the results; if we predicted incorrectly we discard the results.<p>
There is precedence for this; recall those automated combobox dropdowns popular in some desktop and ajax-friendly web applications
that generally display popular searches using your current entry text as a prefix.<p>
Why do this in an interactive shell? In short because a significant amount of the time of a typical interactive shell command is
used waiting for the user to type it in(!).<p>
Imagine the following command being typed:
<code>grep foo /etc/* | grep -v bar</code>
In the time it takes the user to type <code>| grep -v bar</code> the machine could have, in all likelihood, executed the
first half of the pipeline (or, if not, at least started the process of ensuring /etc/* was loaded in RAM).
<code>grep foo /etc/*</code> could be launched in parallel, waiting for the command to be finished.
If the user changes their mind before hitting Enter, the parallel process could be killed and discarded with no side effect.<p>
This does, however, open up some sticky issues. The key to speculative execution is that the results, until confirmed as being
useful, must not affect the system. Clearly we couldn't speculatively run <code>rm</code>, <code>touch</code>, etc. because
they are not side-effect free; same for arbitrary third-party applications. We could proceed sanely by limiting ourselves to a
subset of standard POSIX tools... (though that doesn't fix things like <code>atime</code>, so we might have to limit ourselves
to <code>noatime</code> mounts)<p>
Also note that simply loading sets of file contents referenced in a pipeline command before it is run would likely
greatly reduce latency.<p>
This system would have its downsides, of course; being speculative by nature it would consume resources that may not ever actually
be needed; imagine needlessly loading some huge directory's worth of files over an NFS mount, for example.
Naturally one would want to be able to disable the feature completely, and also to have limitations on maximum RAM usage, and the
ability to disable it from preloading from certain mountpoints of certain types of filesystems.<p>
Despite potential downsides, as the gap increases between latencies between human input, disk and everything else I think you are
likely to see a shell providing speculative execution capabilities in the near future.

<li class=think>Compare/constrast economics of modern construction: software vs. industrial.
I am convinced that the current (poor) state of software construction owes to the lack of application of
modern economic analyses, which are fundmental to the understanding, planning and decision-making process of
every other industry on the planet.

<li class=think>Consider: microkernels lost out to monolithic kernels, but microkernel architecture
is alive and well today in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">hypervisors</a>.
This was a market-driven decision: the market chose simpler, faster monolithic design over the more stable, secure
microkernel design because simplicity and speed are more important features than stability and security to
most people.<p>
However, the market now also chooses the microkernel-esque hypervisors. Why? Because mainstream PCs can handle
it: CPU frequencies are much higher than memory bus speeds, most applications are I/O bound, there are obvious
benefits to the ability to treat an OS instance as data and there are many popular operating systems as application
platforms.<p>
In the end it is features that drive development; the overwhelming majority of the computer-user population
wants the lowest common denominator: more, more, more, at any cost. Security and/or stability at the price of
even minor overhead or hassle is not worth it to most consumers.

<li class=think>Investigate: all mainstream computing today is implicitly probabilistic, from the
obvious applications in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRNG">PRNG</a>s, encryption, hashes and
compression to data structures, allocation algorithms, recursive function calls, unproven libraries, all
applications, monolithic operating systems, CPU caches, floating point math and overflow-masked modular arithmetic.
All of these systems are useful because their success is more likely than their failure, and yet all of
these systems can fail.

<li class=think>Consider: software development as metaphor for life itself : an explicit, constant juggling of tasks,
competing for resources and imperfect solutions. Never-ending reimplementation of solutions to less important problems,
while fundamental problems remain unsolved.

I have a Windows XP host, Linux guest (using 1 virtual CPU) on my 2 CPU laptop. The host is using negligible
resources; but when I do a long-running <code>make</code> in Linux the whole machine starts to freeze up after
exactly 5 minutes. If I kill the job the computer still shows ~100% CPU usage, but eventually settles down.
This is reproducible and disturbs me. Tried filing bug report, but VMWare has a large set of hoops to jump through
and I don't have time for it. Looking into other virtualization products. I am also in the process of getting
a new machine with VT-X I wonder if it'll make a difference.

<li class=programming>Contributing to a large, mature project staffed by very talented people has been a 
great experience so far. I find that it makes me much more critical of my own code, and has given me
an appreciation for the power of seemingly simple, well-designed code; and has me looking at every
one of my own potential patches and thinking 'Is this really the best way? Could I condense this more?
Could I refactor more clearly?' ...which are obviously good questions one should always ask, but in
practice one doesn't.

<li class=llvm style="border-left:1px solid #ccc; padding-left:1em">i've been hearing about <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm</a> here and there for the past couple of
years, but never really took a look. i figured it was immature and not a serious contender to gcc. but recently
i started poking around <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/index.html">clang</a>, the C/C++/ObjC frontend.<p>
the llvm architecture is really nice! and just as importantly, the code is very approachable because it is only as complex as it needs to be.<p>
everything is lib-ized with well-defined interfaces. you can mix and
match parts of the project; so if you wanted to write a tool to analyze C, or generate documentation, or generate
tests you wouldn't need to write a whole parser, you could just use theirs. this interests me because that's
what I'm interested in doing. the code seems very simple and hackable, unlike GCC which is (more mature, but)
monstrous and unapproachable. i've never been a fan of C++, but i think i'll pick it up for the sake of playing
with llvm.

		<li class=llvm>wow, compiling/linking llvm is pretty computationally brutal. i've been trying every machine i have access to and none of them handle it that well :/
		<li class=unix>it's the linking of the debug executable that is so brutal; ld is taking up hundreds of MB of RAM to link together the 150 MB statically-compiled clang-cc, and writing it out to disk everytime is the killer. so even after i change one line of code, it gets relinked again from scratch. there's got to be a better way.

					Carefully investigate any warnings and fix any bugs that cause them.

<li class=pizza style="border-left: 1px solid #ccffcc; padding-left:1em">
I've been thinking about software development lately.
I've been on what seems like a convergence recently of a few different concepts &mdash;
many based on limitation.
<ul class=programming>
	<li>CPUs can execute a fixed maximum number of instructions per second, and no more.
		The biggest optimization gains can be achieved by selection of an algorithm that does
		the least work and still arrives at an appropriate answer.
		A hand-optimized bubblesort in <code>asm</code> is still bubblesort.
		<ul class=programming>
			<li><a href="http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-write-fast-code.html">run fast, do less</a>
			<li>The vast majority of CPU instructions in a compiled program are very boring.
				3/4 or so of instructions are <code>mov</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>jmp</code> and <code>call</code>.
				You can't optimize these. You have to figure out how to make do with fewer of them.
		</ul>
	<li><a href="http://home.pacbell.net/ouster/scripting.html">Programmers can write roughly the same number of lines of code per year regardless of language</a>.
		Combine this with the fact that a line of &quot;higher level&quot; code is equivalent to dozens
		of lines of &quot;systems language&quot; code.
		Given a quota of lines I can write per year, whatever the number, the amount of things I can do
		depends on the expressivity of the language I'm using.
		I can do a lot more in 10,000 lines of Python or Erlang than I can in C.

		Inspired by all this, I get to thinking that microkernel operating systems are a good example of the current thinking in software.
		Microkernel operating systems embody the best design principles, and yet are unpopular because their guarentee of isolation, safety
		and system stability requires a few percentage points of raw performance.<p>
		And then I get to thinking that operating systems basically require C.<p>
		And then I get to thinking that I'd like to be able to design and implement algorithms in a HLL yet produce C.
		Scratch that, it would be cooler if I could parse existing C, transform it into an intermediate functional language and do things
		like modify it and export it back to C, or search for potential bugs in it.<p>

<li class=idea>Idea: music generator program. Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to randomly mutate a song from
an assortment of clips, based on a few general rules. Some basic input from the user could direct it: faster/slower,
this is good/this sucks, etc.<p>
A slightly different bent would be a program containing a "standard library" of clips; a service would store/transfer
"songs", which would just be the instructions in order to combine the shared library clips to recreate the author's song.<p>
You could then take that idea and "tag" each of the library clips, or any combination of them with emotive/audio descriptors
like &quot;agressive&quot;, &quot;harsh&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;. Then songs could be generated/selected based on the listener's
current mood.<p>

<li class=bike><a class="date">2009-05-10</a> Biked the CT coast to Manhattan with folks from <a href="http://www.elmcitycycling.org/">Elm City Cycling</a>. Never ridden in a group before, was a lot more fun than riding alone. Everyone was really friendly. The trip was lots of fun, pretty scenery and the traffic wasn't bad. Biking around Manhattan was so easy and natural; it was fun being faster than the cars for once.

<li class=transportation> <p><a class="date">2009-05-08</a> I commute to work via train and bike. At least, I try to. The Metro North railroad recently changed
their bicycle policy and it's making life harder for bike commuters. I wrote an article about it, have a read:
</p>

<ul>
<li class="quote" style="padding:0.5em; border:1px solid #ccc; background-color:#eee">
As of May 3, 2009 the Metro-North railroad policy regarding on-board bicycles was changed, ostensibly permitting greater access.
As an MTA customer who has been commuting by train and bicycle daily for a year
I can say that the new policy makes things worse, not better.
Today on the 6:01PM Fairfield to Grand Central I saw two cyclists ejected
from the train, one of whom I know commutes daily. He was one stop short of his
destination, and the train was not full... <a href="2009/05/metro-north-policy-says-no-to-bike-commuters.html">read more &gt;&gt;</a>
</ul>

<p>
If you think Metro-North should actually encourage bike commuting <a href="http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/mta_nyc.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">please contact the MTA </a>and say so.

<li class=php><a name="php-just-gets-worse"></a> I'd realized years ago how horrible of a language php is. But amazingly, <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/05/06/180235">php just gets worse</a>. For example, they manage to easily temper the good news of the addition of long-overdue namespaces with the ludicrous use of the '\' character to separate them, when every other language in the Universe uses '.' (This.Makes.Perfect.Sense vs. What\Were\They\Thinking). Today a member of #php ran across another horrific misfeature; a reasonable attempt at string concatenation from a newbie programmer:
<p><code>"a" + "b"</code></p>
This code works well in java, javascript, C# and other languages, resulting in a string "ab". but in php it does the worst possible thing:
<p><code>
var_dump("a" + "b");
int(0)
</code></p>
It happily converts the two strings into integer 0 and adds them, destroying all data in the non-numeric strings with no warnings whatsoever. This is particularly painful because the <code>+</code> operator is a common string concatenator in other languages.
<li class=bike style="border-left: 1px solid #ff9999; padding-left:1em"><p><a class="date">2009-05-03</a> Spent some serious, quality time doing some bicycle maintenance this weekend. It was fun. I'm proud to say that everything I removed eventually made its way back on (except for the <a href="http://ecom1.planetbike.com/7007.html">crappy plastic fenders</a> and enormous amounts of grit and grease stuck under my fingernails, of course).</p>
<p>I've been watching the <a href="http://bicycletutor.com">excellent bicycle tutor videos</a> and referring to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579548830/ref=s9_sims_gw_s3_p200_t3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0RG4ZTG6SWBDK4PKHEJ7&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846">bicycle maintenence guide</a> and am getting more confident about doing simple bike maintenance/cleaning. I'd love to be more self-sufficient; it's definitely in keeping with getting rid of my car in the first place. It's funny; like everything else bicycles are both simple and complex &mdash; fundamentally they're just a frame, wheels, handlebar, seat and drivetrain, but the details are so much more than that... each of the afore-mentioned components are just the required parts; modern bikes have lots of extra parts as well, and for every single component there are at least 3 major variants each containing a whole spectrum of options. And of course, there are interdependencies and incompatibilities, and each one has different tools.</p>

	<li class=unix>OK, so the DNS is moved over, I've got the site partially into git and pull'ed onto the new host; however, I'm not familiar with the exact set up of apache and afaict the structure of my website in git isn't a perfectly clean fit into it. Since DNS hasn't propogated yet I need to test what will happen when it does to try and minimize breakage during the transition; good old bash and netcat to the rescue:
<code>
$ echo -e \
 "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n" \
 "Host: parseerror.com\r\n\r\n" \
 | nc 64.34.176.17 80 | head -n 20
</code>
	That bypasses the parseerror.com DNS and goes straight to the IP host; I used these results to ensure that when DNS does finally propogate the website will appear identically on the new host.

<li class=lisp><a name="gen-scm"></a>I found a source code example of genetic programming (<a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/archive/2008/09/02/1626.aspx">Genetic Programming: A Language Oriented Programming Example</a>) and <a href="pizza/gen.scm">ported it to scheme</a>. With a few tweaks it can generally converge on equivalent expressions (perfect matches) to the "secret function" goal, via fitness function feedback. It all sounds complicated but actually it's pretty simple (see the "evolve" function).<p>

<div id="gaport_details" style="padding-left:0.5em"></div>
<div id="gaport_links" style="margin-left:1em">
Here's what happens when you run it:
<code>
pizza@debian:~/proj/mutant$ time mzscheme -f gen.scm
g dist best
0  873 (+ 5 (- (* a a) (* 7 (+ 9 b))))
1  796 (+ a (* a a))
2  247 (+ (* 4 a) (* a a))
3   30 (+ (+ (+ (+ a 2) a) (+ b b)) (+ a (* a a)))
4    0 (+ 3 (+ (+ (+ (+ a 2) a) (+ b b)) (+ a (* a a))))

real    0m4.903s
user    0m4.099s
sys     0m0.794s
</code>

As the generations increase so does our "fitness" (the "distance" decreases) as we
find solutions that converge toward the ideal solution. Of course in the real world there isn't really
a perfect solution to the "problem" of one's environment (although sharks come to mind).<p>
Because the candidates are generated and mutated randomly (and also because for any ideal solution there
are an infinite number of equivalent answers) the results of the program are always different.
Often the distance converges to zero within the first few generations, but sometimes it gets stuck in
an evolutionary dead end and fails to find a solution within the maximum 100 generations. I'm going to
try to add some logic to backtrack if we detect a potential dead end.<p>

Oh, and I had forgotten how minimal and elegant and beautiful of a language
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> was. Because it is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic language</a> (its code and data are interchangable)
generating code executable expressions on the fly turned out to be pretty easy.
