I checked the result on the page by disassembling <code>/bin/sh</code> and parsing its output with perl:
<br>
<code>
objdump -D /bin/sh | perl -nle'
/^ [0-9A-Fa-f]+:\s+(?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}\s+)+([a-z]+)/&amp;&amp;$h{$1}++&amp;&amp;$n++
}{printf("%d instructions total:\n",$n);
printf"%10s %5d %6.2f%%\n",$_,$h{$_},$h{$_}/$n*100
for sort{$h{$b}&lt;=&gt;$h{$a}}keys %h' | head -n 20
</code>
<p>which yields:</p>
<pre>
218619 instructions total:
       mov 57251  26.19%
       add 20011   9.15%
      call 11086   5.07%
        je 10684   4.89%
       pop  7659   3.50%
      test  7541   3.45%
       and  7112   3.25%
      push  6745   3.09%
       jmp  6092   2.79%
       lea  5975   2.73%
        or  5853   2.68%
       cmp  4909   2.25%
       jne  4772   2.18%
       nop  4649   2.13%
       xor  4062   1.86%
      movl  3835   1.75%
       sub  3067   1.40%
       inc  2800   1.28%
        jb  2706   1.24%
</pre>
<p>...so if you understand those instructions you know <u>exactly</u> what your CPU is doing ~80% of the time. interestingly, all of these instructions exist on the 8086 released in 1979 (technically <code>movl</code> doesn't, it's the 32-bit version of <code>mov</code>). so while, yes, processors are much faster and complicated and have SIMD instructions and all, most of the actual stuff it's doing is nothing new.</p>

<li class=haskell>Well, I've been playing around with Haskell and overall I like it. Furthermore it has all the qualities a language needs to succeed: a solid standard (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/">Haskell 98</a>), an active community, a flagship implementation (GHC), built-in support for software 'modules' (important for encapsulation), a wide variety of libraries GHC can generate fast code (an important real-life quality). That being said, it has some shortcomings, the following which I can identify:
<ul class=todo>
	<li>A complex type system, which apparently requires a degree in Category Theory to even begin to discuss.
	<ul class=todo>
		<li>I've had strange problems converting between types such as <code>Num</code>, <code>Enum</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>RealFract</code>, etc.
		<li>I'm still trying to figure out the type constructors and Monads and all that.
	</ul>
	<li>No named members in tuples (i.e. structs). Passing a tuple around and extracting different members results in code that looks like this: foo@(_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,whatiwant,_)
	<ul>
		<li class=info>There is a way to named members, which is good, but it has its downsides. <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/defining-types-streamlining-functions.html">Real World Haskell: Defining Types, Streamlining Functions</a>
	</ul>
	<li>A moving-target 'Prelude' (standard library). The Haskell 98 standard defines the core language, but apparently the rest changes regularly, with no provision for backwards compatibility. While this keeps cruft out, Haskell will never advance beyond academia  (which may be their goal). For example, I found a reference to a <code>fromInt</code> function in the Haskell mailing list archives; this function no longer exists and has been replaced by <code>fromIntegral</code>
	<li>The GHC is very large and complicated.
	<li>Apparently 'Cabal' is an all-but standardized package system; but I can't get it to install or run properly on Debian.
	<li>The ongoing possibility of adding complexity in the standard library; as Haskell is much more directly math-related than other programming languages it. Hopefully this can be avoided and domain-specific types and activity can be put into modules where they belong.`
	<li>Generating random numbers is more complicated than it should be.
	<li>I/O is hard to figure out, but I'm making progress... I think this is actually ok.

<li class=pizza>Since the parseerror.com logo was pixelated by design anyways, I went ahead and duplicated it at ~1/4 the size;
I figured I could then display it larger, producing the same pixelated look but saving space. It works ok in IE; but Firefox3
blurs the image to try and make it look nicer (which it would, were it a photo for example), but this is counter to my intentions.
<p>
I'm also hoping to reduce HTTP requests by merging all my many, many CSS list icons into a single image and using a CSS
technique based on the <code>background-position:</code> property to access individual sections of that single image, which
will contain my icons. That will reduce HTTP requests from ~120 to 1. <a href="pizza/bg-pos.html">Testing the technique here</a>.
I hope to write a little tool to automate the process, possibly in my new fad language, Haskell.

<pre>WARNING: A file lock request which is blocked can be interrupted
by a signal. In this case the lock operation returns EINTR. Thus you
may think you got a lock when you really did not. A solution is to
block signals when locking. Another solution is to test the value
returned by the lock operation and relock if the value is EINTR.

	<li>Change/patch a busted tube, even if you don't have a pump. You never know when another biker might stop and offer to help.
	<li>If you don't have a pump you can use the tire-filling compressed air machines at gas stations. If you have presta valves (I do) you'll need an adapter (I haven't figured out how to get one to work yet).
	<li>You can buy tube patch kits and <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/category/index.jsp?categoryId=2256572">other bike accessories</a> at Toys "R" Us. There is one halfway through my walk.

Basically what this means is that banks have invested their own money in stocks (securities) that were backed by subprime mortgages. These were bad investments because the people who took out the mortgages usually can't afford them (which is what makes them subprime in the first place). <b>Since the bankers lost their own money, they want the American taxpayers to borrow or print $700 billion and give it to them to replace their losses</b>.<p>
If bankers make money (and they do), everything is fine and their Swiss bank accounts get fatter. However if bankers lose money, that's a disaster! Lose? They may have to wait a few months before they buy that 3rd Bentley or second yacht. So instead of absorbing their own losses, YOU (the American taxpayer) are going to pay them for it. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/24/beck.bailout/index.html"><b>We are privatizing gains and socializing losses.</b></a> It's like welfare for rich people.<p>
This is the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/23/paul.bailout/index.html">biggest fleecing of America in recent memory</a>. The Treasury wants to take $700 billion (they'll get this by either printing new money or by taking out loans from other governments) and apportioning that money however they see fit, amongst the owners of the investment banks that recently failed because they invested in securities backed by subprime mortgages. This plan will:
<dl>
	<dt>Raise inflation</dt>
	<dd><u><i>Your own money</i> will be worth less</u> because there will now be $700 billion new dollars printed up just for the investment bank owners. That's over $3,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.</dd>
	<dt>Reward unwise investment</dt>
	<dd>This is the least tangible of my complaints, but still smacks of socialism. It's not fair. Why reward those who made poor decisions; where is the </dd>
	<dt>Perpetuate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">moral hazard</a> that already exists</dt>
	<dd>If banks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Big_to_Fail_policy">too big to fail</a> why should they bother making wise decisions in the future? No matter what the course of action the men at the top are guarenteed a golden parachute.</dd>
	<dt>Most importantly, this plan <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/23/paul.bailout/index.html">WILL NOT FIX THE SYSTEM</a></dt>
	<dd>It simply perpetuates it by rewarding today those who lost money yesterday. Tomorrow there will be a new bubble and a new bailout.</dd>
	<dt>$700 billion is not the actual price</dt>
	<dd>As with anything the government does, the real price will be [ StatedPrice * <i>n</i> ] where <i>n</i> is some multiple between 3 and 10.

	<dt>Keep watching...</dt>
	<dd>Now that the floodgates have opened, I predict you will see plenty of other 'me too' allocations on the order of hundreds of billions. They will use this current fiasco as a smokescreen to pass other bailouts and laws. Just watch, I'm right.

Unless you own an investment bank or feel like giving thousands of your own dollars to them out of your own pocket then you should <a href="https://forms.house.gov/wyr/welcome.shtml">write your representative</a> in Congress and tell them you're against the bailout plan. You may inevitably get screwed by the rich and powerful, but you don't have to sit there and like it.<p>
It is sadly amusing that the behavior reflected here seems all so familiar after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0912986395?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=parse-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0912986395">The Creature from Jekyll Island</a>. Bank owners and the politicians they own continue to take from taxpayers to line their own pockets whenever they lose money. It is a system designed by the rich few to keep themselves rich.<p>

<li class=bicycle><a class=date>2008-08-25</a> Road bike tires are great; they're light and thin and hard, enabling quicker starts and faster rides. They're tougher against punctures because of their higher internal pressure. So high, in fact (mine are rated at 120 psi) that I could not suitably inflate my road bike tires using my portable mini-pump. And my current 'big' pump doesn't support Presta valves and does not have a pressure gauge. I know I can get adapters to support Presta (and I probably will) but I want a pressure gauge because it makes such a big difference to ride at optimum pressure (without over-inflating one's tubes). So I ordered a new pump and a variety of other stuff... spare tubes, a more complete mini-tool, etc. I looked for a very thin, light adjustable wrench but couldn't find one. My current one seems a bit heavy, and is too thick to help adjust my read caliper brakes.<p>
On the bright side it didn't rain again this morning, I've been very lucky lately; that's bound to change. Oh, and in visiting with my great-aunt this weekend she told me she's been getting by just fine without a car, thank you very much, in the last 60+ years since she left the Navy after WWII. She recommended I take a better look at the <a href="http://www.norwalktransit.com/systemsmap.htm">local bus routes</a>. Puts things in perspective.

<li class=pizza><a class=date>2008-08-21</a> Had my first flat on the roadbike; was passing a stopped 18-wheeler and couldn't avoid a sewer grate. It was a pretty big bang, but I made it about a mile before I realized the tire was flat for sure (which means it's a small hole, that's good as I have no spare inner tube). I figured it would be a &quot;snake bite&quot; flat, and it was. Tried to patch it 3 times and failed. Didn't have a spare tube or tire jacks on me, big mistake.

<li class=bicycle><a class=date>2008-08-14</a> I've been really lucky with weather, no rain this week (yet). Looked like it was going to rain this morning, I was sure of it, but it cleared itself up. Used a chain-cleaning tool on my GT bike last night, first time I've ever cleaned a bike, ever. It was amazing how much grease, dirt and grime came off. Underneath all that dark crap was shiny metal, it was nice to see.<p>
Last Wednesday/Thursday my back tires kept going flat and it must have been the rim. Since the bike shop isn't open on Monday I didn't want to go that long without a bike, and wanted a backup bike in general, so I got my Binanchi while my GT stayed locked up at the train station. Over the weekend the mirror, pump and back light were stolen. At least they didn't take my rack and fenders :/ So the lesson is, never leave anything at the train station.<p>
Also got my rain jacket and rain pants in from Nashbar, they are very light and fit OK, we'll see how well they perform. I'm having trouble finding rain covers for sneakers, and I have big feet so I wonder how easily I'll find them, when I do, in a size 14. Bike commuters must have a shoe solution for the rain... now it's not a problem since I can just wear sandals and get wet because it's warm, but in December when it's 35&deg;F and raining I need a better solution than that.

<li class=bicycle><a class=date>2008-08-12</a> Weather held this morning, though I have a chance of getting wet this evening. Had a nice conversation with a man on the train about my new Bianchi, he recognized the traditional celeste color, had some questions about the frame, headset and casette. He also recommended clipless pedals, and said that once you get them you never go back. Everyone keeps saying that, so it must be true.

<li class=bicycle><a class=date>2008-08-11</a> Weather held up this morning; forecast was for intermittent thunderstorms; which was good because I got a new road bike and it doesn't yet have any fenders. On Thursday my commuter mountain bike blew 3 tires... must be a bad back rim, which I did note was not straight. So now it barely even rolls... I walked to and from work on Friday and discovered an easier route for grocery shopping and some of Milford's bus routes. Unfortunately bike shops seem to be closed on Mondays, so I can't even bring my bike in until Tuesday and then who knows how long it will take to replace the rims. So I got a second bike, a <a href="http://www.bianchiusa.com/07_brava.html">Bianchi Brava</a>, which is beautiful and so light... one can feel the ease at which it accelerates. It came with clipless pedals, meant for riding shoes, but I'm sticking with toe-clips for the moment so I can wear my sneakers. The bike is missing a lot of stuff I need for a regular commute: rear fender or rack, lights, mirror... but it looks so pure and clean I hate to add them (but will). So I'm hoping for clear skies for the next week or so til I get the thing properly outfitted.<p>
Oh yeah, one reason I couldn't get any fenders was because the bike shop said that anything commuter-related: lights, panniers, mirrors, etc. had been flying off the shelves. It's good to hear that people are embracing bicycle commuting, but I wonder how many will still be doing it in January?

I love the simplicity  and accessibility of bike parts... if one of the few dozen total parts needs adjusting, you just do it. I've been told that pumping the tires up to their maximum rated pressure will help reduce flats, I did so, and the ride in today was so smooth.<p>
Went to NYC yesterday, spent some gift certificates at EMS and Paragon Sports. Got some polyester shirts, they're very light and are supposed to wick away sweat well. I've been wearing cotton t-shirts until now; they are hot, soak up sweat like a sponge (and get heavier as they do so) and take forever to dry out.<p>
Rode to Stew Leonard's in Norwalk today; not too bad. In my bike-commuting/city-biking research I'd read something to this effect: &quot;Stop thinking like a car driver... the best bike route will likely be the worst car route and vice versa.&quot; So I did. I got off at a different train station than normal because it is a bit closer and then I took residential backroads the whole way there (calculated via <a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a>). The ride was smooth, there were very few cars and most of the route had shade that the main route wouldn't have provided.<p>
Also, I've been riding on the road, in traffic like one is supposed to on a bike. Previously I was nervous about riding in higher-traffic areas, but I've been more assertive and am trying to be as polite, predictable and speedy when it comes to interacting with cars as possible.

<li class=bicycle><a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/glossary.html">Bicycle glossary</a>
<li class=nocar><a class=date>2008-07-24</a> It was pouring rain today. My current rain solution is gym clothes + flip-flops + cheap poncho. Poncho covers my everything except my lower legs and forearms, and most importantly: my backpack. I arrived at work today no drier than if I had jumped into a pool with my clothes on. I rode through a knee-deep flood underneath the overpass on Old Gate Ln got properly splashed by two cars, and got wet from underneath via my un-fendered back tire, which not only managed to get my shorts soaked, but also my backpack and the clothes and papers in them. I arrived a bit drier (my shirt) than if I had just walked in my regular clothes, but no much. Things I need to do, in order of importance:
<ul class=todo>
	<li class=done>Buy and install a rear fender. This should keep my shorts and my bag drier.
	<li class=done>Get a rear rack; I'll get some panniers too, but in the meantime I can at least strap my backpack there; it'll keep my back cooler (it's amazing how the backpack blocks air and traps sweat).
	<li class=done>Start bringing a week's worth of clothes on Monday morning instead of bringing my clothes every day (I already leave my shoes at work). Wrap them in a garbage bag, even if it's bright and sunny out. This will keep them dry from a daily soak and will mean I'll be hauling less on an average day.
	<li class=done>Figure out a better rain outfit, probably a proper rainjacket and pants. I want stuff I can layer, because even though the weather is warm now, it's going to be terribly unpleasant (and unhealthy) to get wet in November or December.
</ul>
<li class=nocar><a class=date>2008-07-23</a> The weather forecast looked OK at the beginning of the week now says intermittent rain for the rest of the week, including today. It was raining when I woke up, it was raining after the snooze woke me up again, but miraculously it stopped just minutes before we left. What a relief, I hate riding in the rain. I need to get a back fender, at least. Got a flat tire about 2/3 of the way to work, I have a patch kit but no spare innertubes and no portable pump, so I'll be walking to the bike shop to get some.<p>
Got the stuff at the bike shop; patched the flat on the train platform and <i>on</i> the train, that was interesting. I'm getting better at this stuff, but I need to be better prepared. Speaking of prepared I have been riding in junky clothes: an old cotton t-shirt and gym shorts; sneakers if it's dry and sandals if it may rain. Not the best attire in terms of functionality or appearance.

<li class=nocar><a class=date>2008-07-22</a> Train was ~8 minutes late today; conductor said they were held up in Stamford. Had a dentist appointment for which I was 10 minutes late for instead of 2; slightly later to work than I wanted to be.
<li class=nocar><a class="date">2008-07-20</a> It's been weeks since I last drove my car. I do not miss it. I do not miss the stress of driving; I do not miss highway traffic jams; I do not miss staring into the sun on the way home. I don't miss filling up the gas tank. My legs are getting stronger, though I'm not losing any weight since I eat more now (I'm hungrier!). Got some new, more street-friendly tires on my mountain bike frame ($20 each); the ride is definitely smoother. Coupled with my stronger legs I am now able to do most of my morning ride in the highest gear... wish I had a higher gear for some of the downhill stuff.<p>
Not everything is perfect, my wife's commute is a few minutes longer since we have to both walk to the train station instead of drive; she complains and says there are things she'd like to do if we owned a car (things like camping, visiting friends on Long Island, etc.)<p>
Transporting heavy things has gotten more interesting... I biked home a ~25 lb bag of potting soil last weekend, which wasn't bad. However, we now need a more robust ~200 lbs of additional gardening supplies (soil, cow manure, peat moss, etc), and we also want to be able to shop at Stew Leonard's, an excellent dairy/grocery shop on the other side of town. A solution to the gardening supplies problem is to rent a pickup truck from Home Depot for ~$20 and do my own delivery.
We can probably get to Stew Leonard's via the bus, but unfortunately there is no single bus route from our neighborhood to Stew's &mdash; it may be possible to combine train and bus though, I'll have to see if that'll work. A solution to both would be some sort of short-term car rental/borrowing.<p>
As far as renting a car, in my home state of Connecticut it is illegal to drive without some sort of insurance; I am currently still insured from my previous car; but I'm interested in finding a per-day or per-trip insurance company so I'm not out $1600/year for full-time insurnace, but am still legal and covered when I do drive. Assuming I can sort this out I think that the occasional short-term auto rental could solve my current outstanding issues.<p>
I've already checked out <a href="http://zipcar.com/">zipcar</a> and I may try getting there by train and driving ~40 miles back to my home; its's till the cheapest option for a few hours of car access.<p>

<li class=garden>Did some gardening this weekend. I walked to our local nursery and bought 10 sweet bell pepper, 5 tomato (3 Mountain Fresh and 2 Big Boy), 2 Thai hot pepper and 1 basil plant, all 15-30 cm tall, for $7 and carried them home. Bought a bag of potting soil and re-potted the basil, Thai hot peppers and 2 of the tomato plants and planted the rest in recently-vacated space we had in our garden. The Chinese brocolli-type plants we had in there didn't do so well, so they got harvested and cooked over noodles; our existing tomato plants (a cherry and a Jetstar) are growing like crazy though.

The problem with this book is that its author has decided not to present the facts and allow the reader to form his own opinion; but instead to pander to the conspiracy theorist crowd and litter its contents with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language">loaded language</a> that effectively kills any credibility whatsoever. The author feels The Fed is an oligopolistic system designed by the wealthy to protect their assets and status, which as far as I can tell from other research is basically true; but his presentation is so twisted that it makes separating fact from speculation a tedious task.

<li class=nocar>Bike commute going pretty well so far. Got new innertube for my mountain bike. Strangley, yesterday my rear brake got out of alignment and was rubbing on the rear rim even in "off" position. Had to detach rear cable for the ride to work, then fixed it with some help from John and a wrench at work.
<li class=nocar>Local bike shop wasn't open today, trying to fix front tire on my <a href="http://www.retrobike.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30747">good mountain bike</a>. Currently using wife's bike (donated by parents), which she has used exactly once and which weights approximately 50 lbs and which is approximately 6 inches too short for me. It's amazing the difference the bike makes. Apparently my good bike has "Slime innertubes", meaning that they have some liquid in them that is supposed to "heal" any punctures; looks like they're at the end of the line. I need to familiarize myself with the gorey bike part details and get some tools and spare parts (especially since the only bike shop within riding distance has inconvenient hours and rediculously long turnaround times). One of the things I always regretted about owning a car was my near-complete uselessness when it came to diangosing problems or fixing them; I've read about how combustion-engine automobiles run, but there is a world of difference between understanding the book and being able to *do* something (workshop, parts, vendors, networking, etc.)

<li class=nocar>My Jetta broke down and would cost more than it's worth to fix it. I am in no rush to get another car, as I have always hated them, and this is a good excuse to try living without one. I take the Metro North train line from my house in South Norwalk, CT to Milford, CT and then walk or bike to work.<p>
I bought a decent but old roadbike in Manhattan (via <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a>) biked at first, but there is much broken glass on the roadside and unsurprisingly my bike got a flat tire. Then I tried to take the tire off to patch it and stripped the bolt (this is a pre-easy)

<!--li class=windows>babble: check <a name="babbletime" href="pizza/c/babbletime/">babbletime</a> out, it calculates latency in CPU cycles in Windows "real-time" threads. When running a Windows in "normal" desktop mode I get a "Mean/max latency ration" in the neighborhood of 20,000x (a run of 1 second yields a minimum latency of 36 nanoseconds and a maximum of 2.2 milliseconds); the best ratio I can get is around 2,000x if I boot Windows to "Safe Mode with Command Prompt".<p>
If anyone has any clues/tips on how to improve the average scheduling latency of a process in Windows, please let me know, as I'd be interested for myself (I've already recommended a real-time OS for someone running software with hard deadlines).
