<li class=coding>I think that the programming model for massively parallel systems will be more functional than imperative. Common imperative languages don't include the right kind of information to facilitate auto-parallelism. I'm working on designing a programming language and interpreter will automatically partition and execute general-purpose programs in parallel. The language currently looks something like a combination of the best parts of Scheme, Haskell and Python; but it's far from finished. It's a big project; I'll post something up here as soon as it's worth sharing.

<li class=learn>I caught the show &quot;Man-Made&quot; over the weekend on The National Geographic channel. I found it profoundly satisfying because of its engineer-like treatmeant of the subject. The topic of the show was the bra. It begins with an introduction of the bra and lays out its practical importance and cultural history. Then we are given an overview of the design process via the design of a single new bra. Through the design the whole is broken down into its constituent pieces. We then learn how those pieces are made from their constituent parts and so on back to the original dependency raw materials: silk from silk worms, spandex from oil refineries, dye from its chemical components, plastic and steel. The methods and tools involved in each step of the process are covered. The show wraps up by taking us through the entire now-understood process and covering some other miscellaneous but interesting facts. I found it thoroughly enjoyable, interesting and educational. There is hope that someone watching these shows learns not only the specific details of how one type of everyday object is made, but the overall pattern of how to learn about a subject. Maybe there is hope for TV after all.

It is an interesting (and certainly morbid) journey through the Euro- and Brit-centric history of elemental poisonings, both accidental and intentional. Even though I'm going through an &quot;elements phase&quot; at the moment this book was still a mixed-bag; some aspects of poison were intriguing while other accounts dragged on. Many of the poisoning accounts read straight out of a murder mystery, carrying on for some time and involving many characters. Inevitably all the accounts were of upper-class folk, as the lives of the poor are undoubtedly less well-documented and involve fewer international trysts. While I took away some practical information from the reading I think I won't be hanging onto this one.

Watson is equal parts memoir, history book, textbook, gallery of scientist personality profiles and soapbox for his (unsurprisingly) pro-GM stance. Highlights include Watson's account of the Human Genome Project and the account of human evolution as it is currently understood via genetics. While I personally found high school biology to be completely dry and inaccessible I feel that Watson and co-author Andrew Berry do a good job of describing the the function and importance of DNA and various DNA-related technologies. A book trying to cover so many topics necessarily can't be terribly thorough on any of them, but it did pique my interest on a few topics which I plan on delving into in more depth elsewhere. As for grievances: while I don't necessarily agree with all of Watson's opinions my major complaint would be that the book, at over 400 pages, was a bit longer than it needed to be. I'd borrow this one from the library.

<li class=haskell>I've been thinking about how to efficiently manage a list of timers after seeing the
same issues/solutions in Linux's tickless feature, libevent and mod_spox; this is some Haskell to treat
a sorted list as a tree and insert an item in O(log n) work.
<code>
insert p i []     = [i]
insert p i (x:[]) | p i x = [x,i]
                  | otherwise = [i,x]
insert p i l      =
  do
    let (lo,hi) = splitAt (div(length l) 2) l
    if p i (hi !! 0) then
      lo ++ (insert p i hi)
      else
      (insert p i lo) ++ hi

big (x:y:xs)    | x &gt; y = big(x:xs)

<li class=nyc>Julia and I went to Discovery's Shark Week 20th Anniversary party at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan last night; it wasn't as much fun as the Planet Earth kickoff, but hey, I'm not complaining. After the usual speeches and ads for upcoming shows we were treated to an extended sneak preview of the movie Ocean of Fear, which is a recreation of events following the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in the Phillipine Sea in 1945. This is the story made famous by Robert Shaw's Quint in Jaws; the movie is fittingly narrated by the ever-nasal Richard Dreyfuss. 800 mean went into the water, 317 came out 4 days later. The movie was engaging and well-done; two of the surviving sailors, now in their 80s, praised the account as authentic. That said, the show is graphic and frightening as Julia, clinging to my arm the entire showing will tell you, and I did see many people get up from their seat over the course of the hour. Of course, a movie about 500 men being eaten by sharks <u>should</u> be terrifying.<p>
So while attending the event was a no-brainer, getting there was a bit of a challenge because of a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2101000.ece">steampipe explosion on Lexington and 41st</a> and everything was closed off for several blocks in all directions, including Grand Central. Subways weren't running and no one was being let in on 42nd. Everything worked out fine, we simple took fewer subways and did more walking, buses and cabs than usual. By 10:30 42nd still wasn't open, but we found the north entrance on 47th and managed to catch Metro North that way.

<li class=food>I baked my second, third and fourth loaves of sourdough bread; the second was worse than the first, third was worse than the second, and the fourth resembled the first, which remains my best effort.

I'm going to switch to some sort of white flour and see if I get any better results; the whole wheat bread is just way too dense.

<li class=food>I baked my first loaf of sourdough bread today. My bread consists of whole wheat flour, filtered chlorinated tap water, unsalted butter, cane sugar and rock salt. It is an attempt of mine to better understand what my food is, how it is made and where it comes from.<p>
It actually came out as a good-looking <a href="http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--38366/boule-bread.asp">boule</a>; it is not quite rock-like, but it has not risen enough. It is edible but not very good; nevertheless, a start. I thought my problem was adding salt too early, so in my second loaf I added the salt 30 minutes after the initial mixing; to no avail, the second loaf is identical to the first, except it looks worse :-/. I've been letting the loaves rise for about 3-4 hours, I think for the third loaf I will try letting it rise overnight.

These are seperate functions all performing the same task: converting a 32-bit unsigned integer into its ASCII-ized
binary representation (i.e. 0x01234567 -&gt; "00000001001000110100010101100111"); decToBin() was a naive implementation and
I optimized for speed from there. I applied some things I've really only truly learned recently, such as the speed of
table lookups and the speed of branchless algorithms; I further learned that GCC can do things like completely optimizing
any mention of memcpy() away while still performing its operations(!). I also learned that it's much easier to give GCC
good C code and let it generate the asm than try and second-guess it, at least in this case.

			<li class=computer>So today someone mentioned that the fastest way to compute a "<a name="popcnt">popcnt</a>" in an 8-bit unsigned integer was a lookup table. I was familiar with the popcnt methods using &quot;sideways addition&quot; in the <a href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~osvik/amd_opt/">AMD Optimization Manual</a> and <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetNaive">Bit Twiddling Hacks</a>. I wondered how the different methods compared speed-wise, so I <a href="pizza/c/popcnt.c">tested</a> them. Long story short: table lookup for an 8-bit int was 50% faster than the popcount magic. I wondered how they compared using 32 bits, and lo-and-behold, calling the table method 4 times was 25% slower than the equivalent 32-bit parallel popcount... but I modified the table lookout to do 2 16-bit lookups instead of 4 8-bit lookups, and it is indeed about 40% faster than the pop count, thus relegating the magic to situations like an embedded device where resources are very constrained, or where it is used to <a href="pizza/c/popcnt.c">initialize a 65536-item table lookup</a> (similiar to how asymmetric public key crypto is used to bootstrap the faster symmetric algorithms in SSH).
<code>
/* 32-bit parallel population count */
int popcnt(uint32_t v)
{
  v = v - ((v &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x55555555);
  v = (v &amp; 0x33333333) + ((v &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 0x33333333);
  return ((v + (v &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0xF0F0F0F) * 0x1010101) &gt;&gt; 24;
}

			<li class=coding>I'm sure I'm not the first one to figure this out, but a very handy way of transferring files between 2 machines using only a shell and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a> is to run
			<p><code>nc -l -p <i>someport</i> &gt; somefile</code> on the receiving side and
			<p><code>nc -q0 <i>somehost someport</i> &lt; somefile</code> on the sending machine.
			<p>Handy where you can get a limited shell environment on the receiving side but not much else.
			<li class=coding>So I have this app I wrote and I wanted to get it working on a MIPS platform. Well it turns out that the Linksys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G">WRT54G</a> uses a MIPS processor, how convenient. Once you <a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/LinksysWrt54g#head-251f20b55583fc4596fd8d6fd7b129eb1f134e3e">get a shell on the WRT54G</a> and compile a <a href="http://uclibc.org/toolchains.html">uclibc toolchain</a> then you can cross-compile apps from your x86 (ok, Intel, <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/Pentium4/documentation.htm">IA-32</a>) box, scp them to your WRT54G and then let them crash! Wonderful.<p>
So my app uses <a href="http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>; I found that it segfaulted at event_init(); not good. Turns out the WRT54G doesn't have epoll of course, so you need to set the environmental variable EVENT_NOEPOLL. So now:
<code>EVENT_NOEPOLL=1 ./myapp</code>
crashes some more. Whoops, it's crashing when I call libc's getopt() to parse cmdline options (i.e. main()'s argc and argv). This should just work. Turns out that certain versions of uclibc corrupt argc and argv... yikes, nothing is sacred.

			<li class=eww><a name="handscan"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics">Biometric</a> identification seems to be all the rage these days; for example one institution of which I know has installed a <a href="http://www.timesystemsint.com/About_Us/HP3000/hp3000.html">TSI Handpunch TSI H 103</a> which clocks you in and out of work via your bare hand instead of a punchcard. One interesting unintended consequence? It is the one place that everyone in the whole office must press and hold their bare hand twice each day. Given that your <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/13/toilet_filthy/">hands are the least sanitary part of your body</a> (<a href="http://uanews.org/pdfs/germsurvey.pdf">things our hands touch like dishrags, office phones and keyboards contain far more germs than a toilet seat</a>) I would posit that hand scanners are a wonderful, high-tech way to spread germs.<p>
			Now, I'm no <a href="http://downwithsnark.blogspot.com/2006/06/on-allergies-and-george-carlins-advice.html">hysterical germophobe</a>, but I'd rather accept a piece of used chewing gum from a stranger than slide my hand onto an uncleaned plastic slab containing the daily grease and germs of an office full of people, especially during flu season.<p>
			I would suggest first and foremost that if you're considering one of these machines for whatever reason you not install it due to its privacy implications; but if you do
			install one please provide an adjacent sink and/or hand sanitizer; if your institution already has one, speak up and <i>say something</i> &mdash; you sure as hell would if your office had a single toilet with no tissue or sink, and this is worse.

				<li>there is a tiny restaurant around the corner from the Green Tortoise hostel in San Francisco, the name escapes me, but it has a blue marquee and the <b>best</b> (and cheapest) Vietnamese food I have ever had. we gorged ourselves on spring rolls, coffee, beer, vegetables and enormous bowls of delicious soup and paid less than $25 for two. highly recommended. (note: it's authentic, so if your idea of authentic asian cuisine is General Tso's chicken you might not like it)

Besides, the reason Iran would want nuclear weapons is because the country listed right before it in Bush's &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; was invaded. If the USA would stop its extremist foreign policies then perhaps its potential opponents might have less of a reason to resort to extremes. My neighbor doesn't own a gun, and I don't particularly want him to; but if I threaten to kill him and then add his name to a &quot;People To Kill&quot; list then he may go and buy one.<p>
			But none of this particularly matters because those who control USA foreign policy aren't particularly interested in world peace or stability.

			<code>svn co svn://parseerror.dyndns.org/LANassert/</code>
			<p>
			LANassert is a userspace command-line program targeted at network admins and nosy programmers.
			The user writes a series of rules (assertions) describing what healthy, good traffic on their network is supposed to look like
			(i.e. &quot;All DNS traffic should go to/from Official DNS Server 1 or 2&quot;).
			LANassert applies these assertions to network traffic in real-time and notifies the user when one of them <i>doesn't</i> match.
			Using this feedback, the user can investigate the cause of this traffic &mdash; correcting misconfigured boxes, investigating suspicious traffic,
			and augmenting the ruleset.
			After a few rounds of feedback the user ends up with a set of rules that accurately depicts what their network <i>really</i> looks like,
			which is a valuable resource.
			Unlike an idealized, static network diagram the ruleset will show you all the warts of your actual network and can be actively tested.

			<a class=date>2006-09-07</a> I'm trying to put together a Wi-Fi triangulation app for Windows that would allow the location of APs and of client machines, assuming the position of a few APs is known and a few machines on the (W)LAN run it. Unfortunately, the API and documentation from Microsoft are horrendous (par for the course from them). This app would be much easier to write for Linux, but unfortunately that's not an option this time.

I managed to get the virus off the machine, but it made me realize how poor the built-in tools for Windows really are. If I did not already know about and have ProcessExplorer and an anti-virus I would have had a much harder time even discovering the problem, let alone fixing it. What I really wanted once I discovered the rogue processes was the ability to trap them (i.e. throw them in their own jail-like area where they would be isolated from the rest of them system), freeze them (i.e. stop them mid-run and examine them), monitor their activity as well as take complete control over them, (i.e. turn off the ability for them to perform certain syscalls). I will have to investigate if tools like this already exist, and if not...

	<li class=computer>how does one configure a PC to start up automatically once power has been restored after a power outage?
	<ul class=computer>
		<li>some BIOSes have a &quot;Boot On Power&quot; option or some such, must do more research.

		<li class=net>some BIOSes have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-On-LAN</a> which keeps the NIC always on in a special mode -- if it receives a special network message the computer boots up.
	</ul>
	the first solution is more elegant of course, but i thought it would be cool to be enable Wake-On-LAN for my computers at home and have my Linksys WRT54g running a watchdog for them. i've written some almost-working software and have the <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/">Sveasoft</a> <a href="http://docs.sveasoft.com/SV-Guide.html">firmware</a> running on my WRT54g, almost the way I want it. next i need to get gcc <a href="http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.42/doc/crosstool-howto.html">cross-compiling</a> for MIPS so I can run my programs on the WRT54g.

I think that I shall never see
A graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose crucial property
Is loop-free connectivity.
A tree which must be sure to span.
So packets can reach every LAN.
First the Root must be selected
By ID it is elected.
Least cost paths from Root are traced
In the tree these paths are placed.
A mesh is made by folks like me
Then bridges find a spanning tree.
