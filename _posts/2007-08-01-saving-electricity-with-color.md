Can a web page's background color save electricity?
</p>

<p>
I have some input with regards to <a href="http://www.blackle.com/about/">the claim that the color black uses
less electricity</a>.
This claim is TRUE for CRT monitors (the big old clunky ones) but is
FALSE for LCD monitors (the thin kind that come with laptops and newer
desktops).
<p>

BLACK USES THE SAME OR MORE ELECTRICITY ON LCD MONITORS, NOT LESS.
This is backed up on the FAQ from the original site that posted the
power savings calculations <sup>[1]</sup>.
This is because of the way an LCD
works which is approximately opposite of a CRT -- an LCD (think laptop
or digital watch) has a backlight that is on all the time and
electricity is used to change pixels to COVER the white backlight <sup>[2]</sup>.
The more, darker pixels you show, the more electricity you use to
cover them. A CRT (think desktop computer or old tv) works in the
opposite fashion, showing black by default and shooting electrons
towards a fluorescent screen which then lights up <sup>[3]</sup>.
<p>

My own trials viewing google.com and blackle.com and measuring
immediate watts via my trusty <a href="http://www.blackle.com/about/">Kill-A-Watt(tm) electricity meter</a><sup>[4]</sup>:

While blackle saved (significant) electricity on my desktop, it used
MORE electricity on my laptop, not less. Also note that the CRT
viewing blackle still uses almost 4x the electricity than the LCD
viewing google.
<p>
I'm glad to see that the folks at the HoS are serious about saving
electricity; if you're still using a CRT monitor then by all means,
use as many black backgrounds as possible. However, if you use an LCD
monitor (the flat kind) you should stick with regular old google.com
with a light background.
<p>
Some other simple things you can do to conserve electricity while
using your computer:

<ul>
<li>
Switch from a CRT monitor to an LCD. LCDs use a small fraction of
the electricity of a CRT. Even getting an electricity-guzzling CRT for
free can be more expensive over its lifetime than paying a few hundred
dollars for an energy-efficient LCD screen.
<li>
Use a screensaver! Use a "blank screen" screensaver instead of an
animated one. Screensavers are meant to save the screen's pixels from
getting "burned in", not electricity <sup>[5]</sup>.
       <ul>
       <li>Use a white background on an LCD screensaver
       <li>Use a black background on a CRT screensaver
       </ul>
<li>Reduce the brightness of your monitor
<li>Use the Energystar "Power Options" or other "sleep mode" on your
laptop to make it hibernate while inactive
<li>Turn your computer off when you're not using it
</ul>

I challenge you NOT to take what I say at face value, but test it for
yourself. If anyone wants to borrow my Kill-A-Watt electricity monitor
(it's small, harmless and very easy to use) please let me know. Thanks
for your time.
